## About me
Hey, I'm Alan! I'm a Software Engineer Intern at [AppLovin](https://github.com/applovin). I attend the University of California, San Diego majoring in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation and minoring in Computer Science. 🧠

I'm a huge foodie and love spending my free time exploring. You'll often find me vibing to music in areas where I'm surrounded by people. Work life balance is an important part of my lifestyle and having that mix of socialization and self care motivates me to accomplish a lot. 🤩
