## About me
Hi, I'm Alan! I'm currently an iOS Engineer Intern at @airtimemedia. I attend the University of California San Diego, majoring in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation and minoring in Computer Science. I'm a huge foodie and love doing all kinds of watersports from paddle boarding to riding jet skis. 🌊

## How I work
I believe I have a strong mental toughness that enables me to experience a lot in my day to day. As part of maintaining that confidence, I like to use calendars to visualize my deadlines and kanban boards to organize my daily goals. 😁

You'll often find me vibing to music in areas where I'm surrounded by people. Work life balance is an important part of my lifestyle and having that mix of socialization and self care motivates me to accomplish a lot. 🤩
